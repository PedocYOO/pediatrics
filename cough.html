<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever" target="_blank" title="fever의 정의">Fever</a>, also known as pyrexia and febrile response,[6] is defined as <strong>having a <u>temperature</u> above the normal range</strong> due to an increase in the body's temperature set-point.
<p style="margin-top:45px">
  There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37.5 and 38.3 °C (99.5 and 100.9 °F).[6][7] The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold.[1] This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.[2]

  <span>When</span> the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.[2] Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure.[3] This is more common in young children.[3] Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 °C (105.8 to 107.6 °F).[5]
